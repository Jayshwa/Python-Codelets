# Python Codelets

A collection of small, self-contained Python scripts and code snippets (what I'm calling "codelets"). Think of this as my digital notebook for exploring Python concepts, testing out ideas, and building little tools.

**Purpose:**

This repository serves as a central place to store and organize the small Python programs I write as I continue to learn and experiment with the language. You might find anything from simple utility functions to short demonstrations of specific Python features.

**Contents:**

Each "codelet" will typically be a single Python (`.py`) file focusing on a specific task or concept. Examples might include:

* Scripts for basic string manipulation.
* Functions for number conversions (like the `binary_hex_converter.py` example).
* Small programs to interact with files.
* Demonstrations of Python data structures.
* Solutions to coding challenges.

**How to Use (for myself, and potentially others if I decide to share):**

1.  Browse the repository to find codelets of interest.
2.  Each codelet should be relatively easy to understand and run.
3.  Feel free to use and adapt these snippets for your own learning or projects.

**Contributing (for myself, for now):**

This is primarily my personal learning space. As such, contributions in the traditional open-source sense aren't currently being sought. However, the act of writing and organizing these codelets is the contribution to my own understanding!

**Naming Convention:**

I'll try to name the files in a way that clearly indicates their purpose (e.g., `string_reverser.py`, `file_reader.py`).

**License:**

Unless otherwise specified within a particular codelet file, the code in this repository is under the [Choose a License - e.g., MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/). This means it's generally free to use and modify, but it's good practice to include the license if you reuse the code.

This README will be updated as more codelets are added to the repository. Happy coding!
